I was really young back then (I think about 13) so the first thing that came to my mind when I found out that I could generate tones using the Arduino was to make it play the Nyan Cat theme. \r\n\r\nSo I spent a couple of days laboriously transcribing sheet music to frequencies that the Arduino could play. (I never learnt any musical instruments and so I couldn't read sheet music fluently. Transcribing took a while. :P)\r\n\r\nAnd in the end this was the result! I was quite proud of myself when it worked. \r\n\r\nWhile it's not really anything big this project is special to me because it is what introduced me to the wonderful world of Arduinos and electronics and coding! :)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
