<p>This was one of my first projects using the arduino. I was really young back then (I think about 13) so the first thing that came to my mind when I found out that I could generate tones using the Arduino was to make it play the Nyan Cat theme. </p>

<p>So I spent a couple of days laboriously transcribing sheet music to frequencies that the Arduino could play. (I never learnt any musical instruments and so I couldn't read sheet music fluently. Transcribing took a while. :P)</p>

<p>And in the end this was the result! I was quite proud of myself when it worked. </p>

<p>While it's not really anything big this project is special to me because it is what introduced me to the wonderful world of Arduinos and electronics and coding! :)</p>

<p>Here's a video I recorded of the Arduino Playing the tune!</p>
